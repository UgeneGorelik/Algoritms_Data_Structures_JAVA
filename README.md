# Algoritms_Data_Structures_JAVA
Data structures algorithms written in Java language


Implementation of Data Structures using Java Language

contains Stack,Queue,Binary Tree,Graph Linked List




Binary Tree and The implementation of Binary Tree are implemented in File  BinaryTree:
________________________________________________________________________

DFS 

BFS

Sum of Nodes on level

Linked list on certain level

check if tree is binary

Inorder

GetHeight

check if nodes are in same path




linked List and The implementation of linked List  Algorithms are implemented in File  LinkList:
_________________________________________________________________________________

Find Middle

See if Linked List is palindrome


Graph and The implementation of Graph Algorithms are implemented in File  MyGraph:
_________________________________________________________________________________

DFS 

BFS

Topological Sort



String Algorithms are implemented in File  ArrayQuestions
_______________________________________________
Find number repeated Twice

Two Largest Values



Find Missing Number

Find Duplicates

Find All Pairs That Their sum is passed a a var to func



Remove Duplicates using  Sort

find Zero Sum Subarry


Max Consective Sum

Binary Search

See array If Rotated array passed in Function Value
